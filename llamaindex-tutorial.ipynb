      "Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were\n",
      "writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers\n",
      "were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories\n",
      "were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings,\n",
      "which I imagined made them deep.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school\n",
      "district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th\n",
      "grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the\n",
      "basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got\n",
      "permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with\n",
      "all these alien-looking machines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \n",
      "sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs\n",
      "on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load\n",
      "the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print\n",
      "something on the spectacularly loud printer.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in\n",
      "retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input\n",
      "to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data\n",
      "stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't\n",
      "rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know\n",
      "enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I\n",
      "can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My\n",
      "clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to\n",
      "terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this\n",
      "was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's\n",

      "right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it\n",
      "was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then\n",
      "stopping. [1]  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold\n",
      "as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt\n",
      "watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before\n",
      "I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980\\. The gold standard\n",
      "then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really\n",
      "started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my\n",
      "model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at\n",
      "least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\n",
      "he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better\n",
      "than a typewriter.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I\n",
      "was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to\n",
      "my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to\n",
      "which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What\n",
      "I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much\n",
      "of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate\n",
      "truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in\n",
      "other fields felt could safely be ignored.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was\n",
      "that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided\n",
      "to switch to AI.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that\n",
      "made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called _The Moon is a Harsh\n",
      "Mistress_ , which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS\n",
      "documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading\n",
      "_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ , so I don't know how well it has aged, but\n",
      "when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\n",
      "time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed\n",
      "like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach\n",
      "SHRDLU more words.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so\n",
      "I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those\n",
      "days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming\n",
      "languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly\n",
      "so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I,\n",
      "and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of\n",
      "a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\n",
      "the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected\n",
      "college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but\n",
      "that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was\n",
      "going to do.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love\n",
      "working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even\n",
      "more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 \n",
      "that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major.\n",
      "You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to\n",
      "put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got\n",
      "the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been\n",
      "included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me,\n",
      "but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the\n",
      "time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was\n",
      "also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU\n",
      "clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific\n",
      "moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as\n",
      "practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a\n",
      "program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into\n",
      "some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural\n",
      "language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that\n",
      "there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually\n",
      "understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of\n",
      "teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data\n",
      "structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did,\n",
      "as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about\n",
      "various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get\n",
      "us Mike.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans,\n",
      "and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its\n",
      "own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the\n",
      "main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp.\n",
      "In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how\n",
      "little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's\n",
      "nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book,\n",
      "_On Lisp_ , wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems.\n",
      "The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted\n",
      "to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory  indeed, a sneaking\n",
      "suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves  but building\n",
      "things seemed so much more exciting.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program\n",
      "you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at\n",
      "best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would\n",
      "actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with\n",
      "a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it\n",
      "had been good.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at\n",
      "one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was\n",
      "briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the\n",
      "point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened\n",
      "to systems work.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where\n",
      "he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where\n",
      "I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized\n",
      "something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right\n",
      "on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\n",
      "become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily\n",
      "as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really\n",
      "industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to\n",
      "survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a\n",
      "boss, or even need to get research funding.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I'd\n",
      "never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made\n",
      "art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people\n",
      "who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were\n",
      "mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in _Life_ magazine. The\n",
      "idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun,\n",
      "seemed almost miraculous.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take\n",
      "classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going.\n",
      "If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said\n",
      "anything.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an\n",
      "artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at _On\n",
      "Lisp_. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically\n",
      "on multiple projects that were not my thesis.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out of grad\n",
      "school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert\n",
      "Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was\n",
      "envious that he'd found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor\n",
      "Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I\n",
      "didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the\n",
      "quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one\n",
      "in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of _On\n",
      "Lisp_ where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay\n",
      "\"Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should\n",
      "have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there\n",
      "that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school,\n",
      "and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and\n",
      "the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art\n",
      "school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back\n",
      "from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to\n",
      "go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only\n",
      "25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a\n",
      "transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The\n",
      "foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects\n",
      "like drawing, color, and design.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the\n",
      "Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England\n",
      "instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in\n",
      "Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me\n",
      "leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd\n",
      "done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived\n",
      "cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Only _stranieri_ (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it\n",
      "may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many\n",
      "_stranieri_ attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian\n",
      "students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at\n",
      "painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't\n",
      "know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the\n",
      "essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\n",
      "intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\n",
      "vocabulary. [2]  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I\n",
      "was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of\n",
      "learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be\n",
      "disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the\n",
      "Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since\n",
      "arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to\n",
      "teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to\n",
      "learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to\n",
      "the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little\n",
      "stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and\n",
      "a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except\n",
      "hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent\n",
      "their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in\n",
      "American art magazines.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living\n",
      "from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer.\n",
      "She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy\n",
      "and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]  \n",
      "  \n",
      "While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my\n",
      "bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because\n",
      "I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at\n",
      "the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the\n",
      "subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than\n",
      "about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the\n",
      "traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person,\n",
      "which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a\n",
      "still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing.\n",
      "You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic\n",
      "accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a\n",
      "head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that\n",
      "the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge\n",
      "of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that\n",
      "are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but\n",
      "in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In\n",
      "everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual\n",
      "perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain\n",
      "\"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest\n",
      "and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and\n",
      "position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday\n",
      "life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you\n",
      "have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do\n",
      "there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of\n",
      "trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can\n",
      "after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for\n",
      "granted.  \n",
      "  \n",

      "  \n",
      "Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and\n",
      "gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student\n",
      "had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my\n",

      "  \n",
      "This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it\n",

      "  \n",
      "Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new\n",
